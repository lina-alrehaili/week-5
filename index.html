                    <h2>JavaScript Basics</h2>
                    <p>javascript is a cross-platform object-oriented scripting language. javascript is extremely popular
                        for a variaty of reasons. It is a small and lightweight language allowing maximum flexibility for
                        developers to take it in a bunch of different directions.
                        Javascript lives inside a host enviroment (a web browser or Node server), it can be connected to the
                        objects of these enviroment to provide programmatic control over them.
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><a href="#">Variable Declaration</a> Javascript variables are containers for storing data values
                            - imagine a cup you fill with coffee, the cup holds the coffee, a variable holds a value.
                            All JavaScript variables must be identified with unique names. These unique names are called
                            identifiers. var x;</li>
                        <li><a href="#">Variable Assignment</a> Assigment operators assign to JavaScript variables - our cup
                            can now have coffee poured in it, giving our variable a value to hold.
                            The = assigment operator assigns a value to a variable. var x =10;</li>
                        <li><a href="#">Data Type</a> Data types are an important concept; to be able to operate on
                            variables you need to know the data type. There are six data types that are JavaScript primites:
                            Boolan - true or false; null - null aka nothing; Number - 42 or 3.14159; String - "Coding Dojo
                            Rocks!"; Array - [1,'Coding',2,'Dojo']; and Object - {first_name: "Jane", last_name: 'Doc'}</li>
                        <li><a href="#">Conditionals</a> When you write code, you want to perform different actions for
                            different decisions - hitting different code blocks based on values or conditions that have been
                            met. You can use conditional statements in your code to accomplish this. There are the following
                            conditional statements: if a specified condition is true,
                            do this code in our code block; else if to specify a new condition to test, if the first
                            condition is false; else we execute this block of code;</li>
                        <li><a href="#">Loops</a> There are many different kinds of loops in every programming language, but
                            they all essentially do the same thing: they will repeat as action some number of times.
                            Imagine you have to run a mile, well you run around the track four times and then you stop.
                            Thats a loop!</li>
                        <li><a href="#">Functions</a> Functions are an encaspulation of a code block. When we call our
                            function this will run that code block. Think of it as a list of instructions. As an example
                            Imagine we are putting together a desk from Ikea, we open up the instruction manual and get
                            started, first we screw the legs to the table top; next we place the table the right way up.
                            Done! We finished our instructions.
                            Sadly there are a ton more tables to do so lets call our function over and over and over again.
                        </li>
